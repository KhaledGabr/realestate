# Real Estate CMS ( Django )
This is simple web application that gives realtors the ability to add, edit, and delete property listings to their website. The project is currently for educational purposes only and is not yet ready for production use.

### Features:
You can  Create, Read, and delete properties using with a simple dashbaord. 

### Work Done:
* HTML/CSS Code Written using a ready-made PSD template.

* Django Models: A model is Python Classes that represents Database tables. It is important to use objects, instead of SQL statement Strings when developing web application because it makes debugging, and extending features more easily. Currently, one model only is create, which is Property Model, that holds fields like Property address, price, owner_name, etc.

* Django Views: A View, or as it is known in other frameworks as Controller is what maps a URL to the HTML templates. Quering and updating the data base is also done in views if needed. I implemented five views the demonstrate the main CRUD opertations; however, I have a two reading views, One is used to list all realestates, and the other is to list only a single one.

* Django Forms: Django makes it easy to add Forms, and validate users input. Therefore, I used it to create the forms needed to add a new property.

* Django Templates: Using the static html templates, and the Django's powerful templating language, I was able to create data-driven dashboard.
